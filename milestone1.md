# Milestone 1

The goal of this milestone was to implement line following and program our robot to drive in a figure eight.

## Hardware Modifications

We began by attaching the light sensors to the bottom of the robot. We used the line sensors provided, and began with three sensors.

Insert image one.

We had some issues with getting consistent readings from the line sensors, so our first solution was to put the line sensors closer to the ground. We did this by switching out the wheels. This did not entirely solve the problem.
